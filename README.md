##Mobile Friendly?....Yes! 



## Improvements
With additional time I would make the following improvements:
    - more testing parameters 
    - more details in the modal page. I would like to see if I can get more of the key properties of the NFTs to be displayed nicely
    - Some of the pages go to an openSea page that's not valid anymore. I would like to see if I can catch that error or display that warning before the user clicks         the buy button
